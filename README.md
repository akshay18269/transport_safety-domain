Road transport safety domain:

This project analyzes road traffic accident data to uncover patterns and key factors that influence accident severity using **exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques**.

The study investigates important aspects such as **accident trends over time, seasonal patterns, districts with higher accident frequencies, and how environmental factors like weather, lighting conditions, and road surface conditions affect accident severity**. It also examines how accidents vary across days of the week and whether certain **road types or junction characteristics contribute to more severe incidents**.

The dataset includes detailed attributes such as accident date, day of the week, accident severity, geographic location, lighting conditions, junction details, local authority districts, road surface conditions, number of casualties, number of vehicles involved, and road types.

The project workflow involves **data cleaning, preprocessing, handling missing values, exploratory data analysis with visualizations, feature selection, and categorical encoding**. Multiple machine learning models were trained to predict accident severity, including **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost**.

Model performance was evaluated using **ROC AUC, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Confusion Matrix**, and feature importance analysis was conducted to identify the most influential factors contributing to accident severity.

**The results highlight that ensemble models such as Random Forest and XGBoost achieve superior predictive performance. The insights derived from this analysis can help transportation authorities identify high risk conditions, improve traffic safety strategies, and support data driven decision making to reduce accident severity and improve road safety.**
